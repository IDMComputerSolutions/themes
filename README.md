# UltraEdit/UEStudio themes

The official repo for UE/UES editor themes.

### Adding a new theme

Users who are less comfortable with git and/or GitHub are still welcome to submit new themes to support@ultraedit.com. But we encourage
more advanced users to submit any proposed changes or new themes directly through our GitHub repo. Submit a pull request, and once we've 
verified your work, we'll merge, deploy and publish for the rest of the UE community. We thank you in advance for your awesome contributions!

### Downloading themes

If you're only looking for single themes, the easiest way to download is at [our themes page](http://www.ultraedit.com/downloads/extras/themes.html).

It is also possible to download all of the files at once by cloning this repository to your computer, or downloading a .zip file using GitHub's 'Download Zip' button.

Need some info on cloning a repo? GitHub has [a wealth of information on cloning](https://help.github.com/articles/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=clone).

#### Happy editing :)
